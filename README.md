# Hospital Length of Stay Prediction

This project aims to predict the length of stay for patients in a hospital using various patient and admission-related features. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

## Project Structure

- `LengthOfStay.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete workflow for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `datasets/`: Directory containing the dataset files.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: Required libraries and packages

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about patient admissions, including demographics, medical conditions, and admission details.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hospital-Length-of-Stay-Prediction.git
    cd Hospital-Length-of-Stay-Prediction
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook LengthOfStay.ipynb
    ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the regression model is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared (R2) score
